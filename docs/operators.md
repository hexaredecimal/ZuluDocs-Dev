# Operators 

Operators play a crucial role in computing values in programs and calculations in general. Zulu supports
binary, logical bitwise, list and unary operators. All operators are listed below. 

## Binary Operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| +   | Adds two numbers, also concats strings |
| -   | Subtracts two numbers |
| *   | Multiplies two numbers |
| /   | Divides two numbers |
| mod | Computes the modulus of two numbers |


## Logical Operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| >  | Checks if the left side it greater than the right side |
| <  | Checks if the left side it less than the right side |
| >= | Checks if the left side it greater or equal than the right side |
| <= | Checks if the left side it less or equal than the right side |
| == | Checks if the left side it equal than the right side |
| != | Checks if the left side it not equal than the right side |
| && | Performs a logical and |
| \|\| | Performs a logical or |


## Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| <<  | Performs a left shift between two numbers |
| >>  | Performs a right shift between two numbers |
| and | Performs a bitwise and between two numbers |
| or  | Performs a bitwise or  between two numbers |


## List Operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| <\|  | Constructs a new list from two values |

## Unary Operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| ! | Performs a bitwise not |
| - | Negates a number or expression|
