## Key features
- Atoms & Simplicity – Atoms (:hello, :true) provide a lightweight way to represent immutable symbols without additional syntax overhead.

- Powerful List Constructs – Inspired by ML, [x, y] can be formed using x:y, enhancing readability and composability.

- Concise Function Definitions – Say goodbye to {} in function implementations. Functions are defined using = and . for clarity and brevity.

- Universal Block Expressions – Every block { ... } returns a value, making the language fully expression-oriented.

- Lambda Expressions – Inline functions use fn(args) => expr, making anonymous functions more intuitive.

- Struct types - Create data structures with methods and type functions


## Who is it for?
Whether you're a hobbyist, a functional programming enthusiast, a systems programmer looking for a flexible scripting tool, or someone who enjoys experimenting with new languages, [Your Language Name] provides a refreshing approach to code structure and execution.
